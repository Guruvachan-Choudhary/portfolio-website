# My Awesome Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my skills, qualifications, projects, and contact information. I built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Qualification Section
This section displays my education, certifications, and skills. I used HTML to create the structure, CSS to style the layout, and JavaScript to add some interactivity.

## Project Section
1. EDTech WebApplication
My EDtech web application is built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
 MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores the data in JSON-like documents. Express.js is a web framework that handles the server-side logic and routing.
 React is a front-end library that creates dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Node.js is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside the browser.
The web application follows a RESTful API design that allows for easy communication between the front-end and the back-end.


## Contact Section
This section provides my contact information and a form to send me a message. I used HTML to create the form, CSS to style the elements, and JavaScript to validate the input and send the data to a backend service.
